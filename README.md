To be noted:
This bot has 0auth access which means it can only do certain things which include:

1. Creating a text based post
2. Replying to specified 'id' given by user with a text

PS- There are many limiations to having free access since it does this much only as of 2024

If you have more access to the api then you can do much more like following someone, retweet, like a post/tweet etc.
